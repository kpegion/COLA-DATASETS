      dataset_title: Outgoing Longwave Radiation Daily Climate Data Record (OLR Daily
        CDR)
      description: The product contains the 1-degree by 1-degree daily mean outgoing
        longwave radiation flux at the top of the atmosphere derived from HIRS radiance
        observations onboard NOAA TIROS-N series and MetOp satellites. The OLR retrieval
        uses multispectral regression models (Ellingson et al., 1989, Lee, 2014).
        The CDR processing includes HIRS radiance calibration, inter-satellite HIRS
        OLR calibration, normalization of geostationary-based  OLR retrieval to HIRS,
        and grid-based 7-day boxcar temporal integration assisted with Imager-based
        OLR derived from Gridsat CDR data (Lee, 2014).
